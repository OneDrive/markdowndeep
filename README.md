# MarkdownDeep - RGregg Fork

This is a fork of the MarkdownDeep OSS project created by TopTenSoftware.

As of March 2016, that repoistory appears to be no longer maintained.
This is for updates the markdown parser to better handle GitHub Flavored Markdown in support of the [Markdown-Scanner](https://github.com/onedrive/markdown-scanner) project.

## Goals (in this fork)

1. Maintain this library and fix bugs in the markdown parsing and translation to HTML.
1. Support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) more completely and stay up-to-date with changes to GFM.
1. Increase code quality and comments to improve maintainability of this library.
