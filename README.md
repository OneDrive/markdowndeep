# MarkdownDeep - RGregg Fork

This is a fork of the MarkdownDeep OSS project created by TopTenSoftware. 
As of March 2016, that repoistory appears to be no longer maintained. This is an
attempt to update the markdown parser to better handle GitHub Flavored Markdown
in support of the [Markdown-Scanner](https://github.com/onedrive/markdown-scanner) project.
